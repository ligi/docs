What's in the box?
==================

So today you got your TREZOR. Congratulations! The box is protected by two silver seals on both sides. Make sure that both of the security seals are unbroken. Your device should be also wrapped in a thin plastic foil and the package itself carefully sealed with a strong glue. 

Here is how the box looks like:

- Set of stickers (4 pcs)

.. note:: Your TREZOR doesn't have any batteries in it. So you won't see anything on the screen until you plug it in your computer or phone.

Now go ahead and plug in your TREZOR.  You will see the glowing TREZOR lock appear on the screen. For setting up your new TREZOR, please, move on to :doc:`Setting up your TREZOR device <settingup>`.
